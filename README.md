## About
A simple script to get the price of a specific game in all countries supported by steam
On Steam, games are not always sold at the price that your region gives out. For example, some games in Russia are sold for 900 rubles, while in Argentina, a game can cost 700 rubles.
The script works through Steam API. There is an embarrassing moment here. I donâ€™t know how platform protection sooner or later starts blocking your IP for a large number of requests, so set the delay in the script wisely and add 30-50 countries - NO MORE
